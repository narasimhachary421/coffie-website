# Coffie — Digital Coffee Catalogue

This repository contains a responsive, static digital catalogue for Coffie — a professional coffee catalogue intended for dealers and customers. It is not an e-commerce website. Prices are intentionally not shown.

Folder structure:
- `index.html` — Homepage
- `products.html` — Coffee catalogue (no prices)
- `about.html` — Brand story and sourcing
- `contact.html` — Contact form and business info
- `/css/style.css` — Main stylesheet
- `/js/script.js` — Client-side JS (nav, modal, forms)
- `/images` — Placeholder illustrations and product images

Publishing options:

1) GitHub Pages (recommended):

  - Create a Git repository and push this folder.
  - In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages using the `main` branch and root folder.

2) Netlify (drag-and-drop):

  - Zip the site files and drag onto Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop).

3) Manual: upload files to any static host.

Notes:
- The site uses `mailto:` fallback for contact and request forms; replace `hello@coffie.example` with your real contact email in `js/script.js`.
- All navigation links are standard HTML and work across screen sizes.
